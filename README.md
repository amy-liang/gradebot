## What it does
GradeBot has four features designed to make your student life easier. 

1. Produces the grade needed to achieve a final grade

Say you have a 90, want to finish with a 92, and the final exam is worth 50%. GradeBot will output what minimum grade is required to get that 92. 

2. Produces the final grade based on a predicted grade

Perhaps you have an 80, and are expecting to get a 90 on the final exam, which is worth 40%. GradeBot will output your predicted final mark. 

3. Produces the possible grades received based on a final grade

Say you had an 80 going into the final, worth 60%, and ended up with a 70. GradeBot will output a range of marks that you may have received (due to rounding)

4. Converts a percentage to a mark based on total marks

Perhaps you received on 80% on a final exam, and the exam was out of 110 marks. GradeBot will output the possible marks that you received (e.g. 87.5/110, 88/110, 88.5/110)

## What I learned
I was able to improve my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills by doing *slightly* more advanced things such as Javascript functions and grabbing user input from fields. 

## Next steps
I'd like to clean up the CSS and make the site more responsive for other devices like mobile.
